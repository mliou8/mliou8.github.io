It's been a little bit since I've updated my personal site. Quite a bit has changed since then. I've left New York to relocate to Seattle.
I've left Vroom where I was working as a Fullstack Web Developer in order to join Amazon as a Web Developer. I've now been at Amazon for 
3 months and some change. The beginning was pretty intense in terms of ramp up, because there were a lot of new systems to learn.

But in retrospect it was not that different from the ramp up at a startup, except that there's a lot more documentation. Every company has its 
own ideas about how the development process should go, and adapts its tools to suit. Amazon is no exception. 

One thing that is different is that the scale of the work that I do is very different now. Because our carousel is on a main page, ie the 
product detail pages for Amazon products, if a bug is introduced or a feature is developed it has a very wide impact, and millions of people
a day will see it. That's a lot of pressure but also it helps you to stay focused when you're working on a new feature.

It's also interesting to see the types of processes that Amazon has put into place to ensure quality on code that gets shipped.
A long time ago (maybe 4 years ago) I interviewed for a position w/ Quora where I was asked what I would do to ensure quality given 
that they were making lots of deployments. Now 4 years later I don't know if I know the best way to do that still, without asking more questions,
but at least I have a lot more to say about the topic.

In regards to the previous job board, I had a lot of fun with that project but didn't even realize myself that what I was doing was 
signing myself up to be a technical recruiter. Although that's not what I intended to do, I'll be starting a new side project soon and
hoping to explore a different space in social media/connection apps in React Native. To be continued.
