I'm excited to join Spotify this summer as an front end intern! 

Music selection and curation is a super interesting space right now, and it seems like one of the greatest 
differentiators in where people ultimately decide to consume their media. It's such a great challenge from a UI/UX perspective
as well as a really interesting way to study consumer behavior through a widely used app.

Overall, it'll be a fantastic place to develop front end chops, and I'm looking forward to the experience.
