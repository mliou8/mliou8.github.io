It's been roughly two weeks since I officially put gitreferred.com online and it's been a pretty good learning experience so far.

First of all, I learned that whatever you think you want to launch will change by the time you launch it. And the more people you talk to about it
the more you learn about how your service is perceived. I got mostly positive reactions from friends, but a couple of very neutral (I suspect bland) 
reactions. What I learned is that there IS a significant % of people in tech out there who feel the same way as I do, kind of burned out
from third party recruiters, and feel that there's some service to be added in a non-intrusive jobs board.

I started out thinking I was bringing a certain value add to the process (actually doing in depth screening based on cultural requirements) 
but I learned fairly quickly that this may or may not be a commonly required case. But there still might be value added by the way of a technical 
screening process by an engineer before applicants enter the job process.

The hard part so far has been figuring out what a recruiter of a prestigious tech company is thinking, and how to communicate with them. 
I do believe that for the most part, they would appreciate having an additional source of qualified candidates to interview.

The appearance of companies like hired, triplebyte, and indeed prime are proof of this. And undoubtedly those companies are charging
per applicant that they place, or charging people to list jobs on there.

The main takeaway I've gotten so far is that cold emailing is not easy. A lot of times if you sell your service too hard, people are probably
turned off, to the point that they don't know what to say. You've got to really empathize with your customers (right now, the recruiters, later, applicants)
to figure out what their hesitations might be.

My main goal right now is to continue forging ahead, and see how my approach can lend value to the tech hiring space. And the main way to do that
is to keep having conversations with the people around me, and with the companies that I've been talking to.
