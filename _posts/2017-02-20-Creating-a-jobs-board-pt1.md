title: Creating A Jobs Board pt. 1
---

I'm off and running on my first project that I hope to share with people soon! I see a gap in the tech hiring market,
where there's a high quantity of job postings flying around, and a lot of applicants entering the market through coding bootcamps.

My hope is to gather feedback from internal recruiters of companies to help isolate some time saving screening questions
for the positions that they're hiring for. On the applicant side, I want to take away some of the pain from the application process.

I know first hand how demoralizing and frustrating the job search can be sometimes. You send out applications and a lot of times you
get rejected without any real feedback. Or maybe you go in for an interview only to find that they've already disqualified you  
already based on some qualification that you weren't aware of.

I've opted to go with a squarespace account, purchased a domain name called gitreferred.com (reference to git hub, and referrals).
My expenditures so far are a little high, considering I haven't even done a proof of concept (ie are there recruiters and applicants
out there who actually want to use this model for job searching?). I had to purchase the domain name, the hosting from squarespace,
and some stock photos as well. So far I've spent a little over $200. 

I think for a first run I want to err on the side of caution. If having a personalized email account, and a nicely formatted squarespace
site helps me get considered a little more seriously by another person, then I would think it's worth it. I'll probably get better
with future iterations in figuring out what is a necessary cost, or how to validate without anything to see. But who knows, in this day
and age with all this noise, maybe the bare minimum to be considered seriously actually is a squarespace site.

Right now I'm working on implementing some custom CSS and javascript in order to flesh out how I want the screening process to operate,
and then I hope to reach out to recruiters in a couple of days and start information gathering with them.
