title: Learning Object Oriented Java
---

I just recently started an intermediate Java specialization offered by UC San Diego through Coursera. 
The courses and final project look great. The courses that I'll be taking in order are:

* Object Oriented Programming in Java
* Data structures: Measuring and Optimizing Performance
* Advanced Data Structures in Java
* Mastering the Software Engineering Interview
* Capstone: Analyzing (Social) Network Data

With 21 weeks of courses, which seems like a semester worth of classes, I'm hoping that this will be a good way to 
dive into Java. Particularly exciting is that they've recruited 6 or 7 Google engineers to teach some of the content,
and Google's also contributed some project work. Since saying Google uses Java is almost not worth the effort it took to 
write that sentence, I'm interested to see what kind of offerings they'll have in store.

Why study Java and what will I learn that's different from my foundation in Javascript? 
(Note: Java & Javascript are related like a car and carpet are related, that is to say not at all)

* Java is a statically typed language; JavaScript is dynamic.
* Java is class-based; JavaScript is prototype-based.
* Java constructors are special functions that can only be called at object creation; JavaScript "constructors" are just standard functions.
* Java requires all non-block statements to end with a semicolon; JavaScript inserts semicolons at the ends of certain lines.
* Java uses block-based scoping; JavaScript uses function-based scoping.
* Java has an implicit this scope for non-static methods, and implicit class scope; JavaScript has implicit global scope.

Basically, I wanted to widen my exposure to Object Oriented languages so that I can gain a
computer science background. Also because Java has such a huge community behind it, there's rich API support and documentation, 
as well as a lot of open source projects to interact with.

Hopefully I'll have a project to share soon from this course and more updates on it later.
